# Bull Cow Game

Implementation of the Bulls and Cows game using Unreal engine with C++

"Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls) is a code-breaking mind or paper and pencil game for two or more players, predating the commercially marketed board game Mastermind and the hit word game Wordle.

The game is played in turns by two opponents who aim to decipher the other's secret code by trial and error."
